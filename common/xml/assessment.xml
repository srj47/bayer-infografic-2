Even confident and stoically disposed physicians may benefit by giving some consideration to their emotional state. Anger and frustration are natural reactions when sued. Many physicians have negative feelings towards plaintiff’s attorneys and even the clients they represent. Experienced plaintiff’s attorneys are aware of the variety of emotions physicians feel and will seek to use them to their advantage. Venting such emotions not only shatters the calm attitude and manner of a physician but also robs the ability to listen calmly and respond accurately to questions.</p>]]>
